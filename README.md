The app also works regardless of your internet connection. This app was designed to be on the go so users on their mobile devices do not have to worry about losing their information due to internet. All expenses you input when in offline mode will automatically be updated when you restore internet connection.<br>

There is also a feature to install the app on your device to use entirely offline if you do not wish to use the website version of the app.<br>
